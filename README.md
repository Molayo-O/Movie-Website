# WatchedIT - Movie Reviewer Website 

WatchedIT is a web application  that provides users with a platform to explore, review, and rate a vast collection of movies sourced from IMDB's movie database. With WatchedIT, you can build your own personal movie collection.

## About the Project

The main features include:

- Exploring thousands of films from the IMDB database, with details on the rating, plot, runtime, and more.
- Creating a personal profile to keep track of movies you've watched and rate/review them. Your watchlist allows you to keep track of movies that you want to watch.
- Search and filtering, which allow you to easily find movies by genre, year, top rating, and other criteria.

The site was built using modern web technologies including:

- PHP Backend that utilizes a REST API to manage all data requests and manipulations efficiently.
- React Frontend that employs a dynamic single-page application approach for an interactive user experience.
- MySQL Database that stores movie details, user profiles, activity, and reviews for seamless data management.

## Future Functionalities

- Implement social features that allow users to share their reviews and ratings with friends.
- Implement video playback functionality for users to watch trailers or movie clips directly on the website.
